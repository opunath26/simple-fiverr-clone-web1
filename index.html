    <p>Zhenel Rawlinson grew up surrounded by music in Memphis, Tennessee. With a mother who was a recording artist and a father who worked as a Hip Hop producer, music was ingrained in her life from an early age. “I was always involved in music, whether it was at church, school, or in the community,” she said. By the time she was a teenager, she had recorded her first album in her father’s home studio. Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

    <p>But while music was her passion, financial stability was harder to come by. As the first in her family to attend college, Zhenel knew she needed a way to make ends meet while pursuing her goals. That’s when she decided to offer music lessons, starting with just two students. Over time, what began as a modest side gig blossomed into a $1,000-a-month income stream. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.

    <p>Zhenel’s deep connection to music started at home where both her parents were involved in the entertainment industry. “Music was always around me—my mom was a recording artist, and my dad was a producer,” she said. Growing up, she performed in local festivals, regional choirs, and church worship teams, gaining experience and developing her talent. By high school, she had already released her first album with the help of her father’s home studio. Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Maiores at vel, earum modi quo perspiciatis veniam doloribus molestiae. Repellendus rem voluptate magnam officiis at vel sint explicabo consectetur, veritatis iusto.

Perspiciatis culpa quos consequuntur ut odit error atque harum beatae, enim cum neque suscipit nesciunt, inventore architecto adipisci vero assumenda corporis totam esse, dolorem temporibus! Voluptatem earum ratione at nulla labore corrupti illo assumenda eius in nostrum molestiae ducimus, sed odio dignissimos nemo reiciendis eveniet eos libero sit sint? Perferendis molestiae facere nisi non, debitis omnis voluptatibus. Blanditiis, aut repudiandae voluptatum adipisci placeat saepe dolor dolorem est, eos corrupti voluptate iusto. Tenetur quae voluptates quas quidem ducimus quasi libero placeat nulla temporibus. Similique iusto odit sint eius praesentium molestiae magni. Facere vel deleniti nulla consequatur dolorum doloribus accusamus voluptas perspiciatis autem!</p>

    <p>Despite these early achievements, financial pressure was a constant challenge. Raised in a low-income area, Zhenel lived with her mother, sisters, and grandparents, and the family’s financial struggles were always present. “It was tough, but I always felt driven to make something of myself and help my family,” she recalled. Determined to create new opportunities, Zhenel became the first in her family to attend college, enrolling at The Ohio State University with a major in Music (Voice) and a minor in Music, Media, & Enterprise.</p>

        <br>
    <h3>College, however, brought new challenges. While Zhenel thrived musically—headlining concerts and releasing original songs—covering her living expenses and tuition was another story. “I was doing what I loved, but it wasn’t enough to pay the bills,” she admitted. During her senior year, Zhenel realized she needed to make extra money without compromising her passion. That’s when she began offering music lessons on social media.</h4>
        <br>
    <p>After graduation, Zhenel took things a step further by joining Fiverr, the freelancing platform that allowed her to expand her reach beyond her local community. By offering vocal coaching, music production, and songwriting services, her online business idea soon grew into a steady income stream, with some months generating over $1,000. “Fiverr became a way for me to continue pursuing my passion while earning extra money on the side,” she said.
